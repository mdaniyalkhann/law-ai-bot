# Jupyter Notebook Installation and Setup Guide

This guide will help you install Jupyter Notebook and update the `.env` file with necessary API keys.

## Step 1: Install Python

Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Step 2: Install Jupyter Notebook Using PIP

Open your command line interface and install Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Step 3: Run Jupyter Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

## Step 4: Using Jupyter Notebook

Create a new notebook by clicking "New" > "Python 3" in the Jupyter Notebook interface.

## Step 5: Save and Exit

- To save your notebook, click the floppy disk icon in the toolbar.
- Exit Jupyter Notebook by closing the browser window and pressing `Ctrl + C` in the CLI.

## Updating the `.env` File

1. Create a file named `.env` in your project directory if it doesn't already exist.
2. Add your API keys to the file. Replace `<open-ai-key>`, `<pinecone-api-key>`, and `<pinecone-env>` with your actual keys:

    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY="<open-ai-key>"
    PINECONE_API_KEY="<pinecone-api-key>"
    PINECONE_ENV="<pinecone-env>"
    ```

3. Save the `.env` file. Ensure it is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent uploading sensitive keys to GitHub.
```

This markdown formatted guide provides a concise and easy-to-follow set of instructions for installing Jupyter Notebook and updating the `.env` file with specific API keys. Remember to replace the placeholder keys with actual keys provided by the respective services.
